# Employee-Tracker

## User Story
* I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and emploees in my company
* So that I can organized and plan my business

## Description
* This app allows you to use Node and MySql to pull up tables in the terminal to view and change various different parts of the business. Those include view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

## Usage
* You will open a terminal and run node index. This will bring up the list of options I said above. You may then choose one of the options and either the corresponding view or function will be exectued.

## Install
* If you don't already have Node and MySql installed those will need to be installed for the app to work.

## Future Improvements
* I want to make it so all the different options work. Currently all of the view options work but the ability to add employees, roles, departments, or updating an employee is unavalible.
